##  Description
This project focuses on using a predeveloped front and a mongo db back end to create a workout tracker for users. It technically follows an mvc framework with the model,provided by mongoose, the views provided by the served out public folder, and the controller provided by the node express server. Using the developed front end a user can save exercises done to an object that corresonds to exercises done on the latest saved date. The app does not currently account for more than one user and is deployed on heroku. Feel free to check out the deployed application at the link below.

### Installation

As prevously mentioned the app is deployed on heroku so the user can access it that way but they still wish to download and run the app locally they will need, node, express, mongodb, and mongoose. All the dependancies are saved onto the package.json so the user only needs to run npm install once they have downloaded the application to thier local machine.

---

### Usage

The application currently is only capable of tracking the activities of only one user and can be used to keep a simple record of up to seven workouts at a time given the current set up.

---

### Testing

 The user can interact with the app through the diployed site or locally if they choose to download the files. After initial settup they should be able to see the data they save in the stats page displayed in graph form. See the images below for a demo of what the site should look like.
